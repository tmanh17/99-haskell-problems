Collect the nodes at a given level in a list

A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the node has length N-1. The root node is at level 1. Write a predicate atlevel/3 to collect all nodes at a given level in a list.

Example:

% atlevel(T,L,S) :- S is the list of nodes of the binary tree T at level L
Example in Haskell:

Î»> atLevel tree4 2
[2,2]
-}

import Tree

tree4 = Branch 1 (Branch 2 Empty (Branch 4 Empty Empty))
                 (Branch 2 Empty Empty)

atLevel :: (Tree Integer) -> Int -> [Integer]
atLevel (Empty) _ = []
atLevel (Branch x _ _) 1 = [x]
atLevel (Branch x l r) n = (atLevel l (n-1)) ++ (atLevel r (n-1))
