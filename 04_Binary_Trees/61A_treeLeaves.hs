Collect the leaves of a binary tree in a list

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a predicate leaves/2 to collect them in a list.

Example:

% leaves(T,S) :- S is the list of all leaves of the binary tree T
Example in Haskell:

Î»> leaves tree4
[4,2]
-}

import Tree

tree4 = Branch 1 (Branch 2 Empty (Branch 4 Empty Empty))
                 (Branch 2 Empty Empty)

leaves :: (Tree Integer) -> [Integer]
leaves (Empty) = []
leaves (Branch x Empty Empty) = [x]
leaves (Branch _ l r) = (leaves l) ++ (leaves r)
