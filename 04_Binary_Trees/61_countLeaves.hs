Count the leaves of a binary tree

A leaf is a node with no successors. Write a predicate count_leaves/2 to count them.

Example:

% count_leaves(T,N) :- the binary tree T has N leaves
Example in Haskell:

Î»> countLeaves tree4
2
-}
import Tree

tree4 = Branch 1 (Branch 2 Empty (Branch 4 Empty Empty))
                 (Branch 2 Empty Empty)

countLeaves :: (Tree Integer) -> Int
countLeaves (Empty) = 0
countLeaves (Branch _ Empty Empty) = 1
countLeaves (Branch _ l r) = countLeaves l + countLeaves r
