Collect the internal nodes of a binary tree in a list

An internal node of a binary tree has either one or two non-empty successors. Write a predicate internals/2 to collect them in a list.

Example:

% internals(T,S) :- S is the list of internal nodes of the binary tree T.
Example in Haskell:

λ> internals tree4
[1,2]
