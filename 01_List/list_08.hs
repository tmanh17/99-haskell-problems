{-
(**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements should not be changed.

Example:

* (compress '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
(A B C A D E)
Example in Haskell:

Î»> compress "aaaabccaadeeee"
"abcade"
