{-
(**) Extract a slice from a list.

Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.

Example:

* (slice '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3 7)
(C D E F G)
Example in Haskell:

Î»> slice ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','k'] 3 7
"cdefg"
