{-
(***) Conversions

Write predicates to convert between the different graph representations. With these predicates, all representations are equivalent; i.e. for the following problems you can always pick freely the most convenient form. The reason this problem is rated (***) is not because it's particularly difficult, but because it's a lot of work to deal with all the special cases.

Example in Haskell:

λ> graphToAdj Graph ['b','c','d','f','g','h','k'] [('b','c'),('b','f'),('c','f'),('f','k'),('g','h')]
Adj [('b', "cf"), ('c', "bf"), ('d', ""), ('f', "bck"), ('g', "h"), ('h', "g"), ('k', "f")]
